When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
- if you are collaborating with other people it would be helpful to have a remote version of your files that all can access. 
- Also, if you work form multiple computers, like I am now!

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
- because you might have branches that you have been working on on your local machine that you want to preserve
- it is genreally better to have control over your repository

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
- A fork is a clone of someone else's GitHub repository. You use forks instead of making your own clone, because a fork is always linked back to the original owner. You don't have permission to change someone else's repository, but you can fork it and make changes to that on your own GitHub account.
- A clone is an exact copy of a repository. This can be a copy of a remote repository on your local, or a copy of your local repositoty on your local.
- A branch is a part of a repository. You can use a branch of you want to create a new feature, or experiment with something that you don't necessarily want to be a part of your master.
